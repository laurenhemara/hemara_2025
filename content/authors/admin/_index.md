#    summary: |
#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## Kia ora!

I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Microbiome Manipulation Lab at The University of Toronto Scarborough](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/labs/microbiomemanipulationlab/).

 **I'm passionate about understanding microbial evolution and niche adaptation, from laboratory environments to the field — and back again!**

 My current research seeks to examine tradeoffs between the production, storage, and field application of microbial bioinoculants for agriculture. 
 
 My doctoral research used the kiwifruit pathogen *Pseudomonas syringae* pv. *actinidiae* to understand how plant pathogens evolve during incursions. Using this horticulturally-relevant pathosystem, we examined effector requirements, redundancies, and repertoire refinement across susceptible, tolerant, and resistant hosts.
